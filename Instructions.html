      <h1>How to Play</h1>
      <p>This game works similiarly to normal Jeopardy with some differences. You will answer as many questions as you want and the ones you get right will be added onto your score. To get a question to appear, click on the card with the point value you want. Then if your score is in the top 10, you will be on the leader board. To submit your score, make sure you answered the questions you wanted and type in your name in the box. Make sure to hit submit after every thing is answered.</p>
      <p>There are some specific ways the questions need to be answered. Any number answers will be in the numerical value, not in letters. The numbers also use their commas in intervals of three. All words will start with a capital letter. If a question has a F in parenthesis next to it, then the answer is only the first name.</p>
