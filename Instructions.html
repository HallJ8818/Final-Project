      <p>Any number answers will be in the numerical value, not in letters. The numbers also use their commas in intervals of three. All words with 4 or more letters will start with a capital letter. The first word will always be capitalized. If a question has a F in parenthesis next to it, then the answer is only the first name.</p>
